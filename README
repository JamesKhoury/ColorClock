This is a JavaScript version of The Colour Clock (http://thecolourclock.co.uk/) by Jack Hughes (http://www.lookatjack.com/). I tried to keep this version as true to the original as possible - the biggest difference is that the color I calculate is a little different from the original version (but not that much!). The idea and Flash implementation are Jack's; I've only ported this over to HTML/JavaScript to be able to run it on iOS devices, web enabled TVs and what have you.
